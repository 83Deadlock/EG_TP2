# Source-Code-Analyzer

This practical assessment had the goal of building a source code analyzer for a custom imperative programming language, which also had to be defined by the group. This language had to support declaring atomic and structured variables like sets, tuples, lists and dictionaries; conditional instructions (if, elsif, else) and three different types of cycles (for, while and repeat).

The language processing module Interpreter from Lark was used to generate HTML files reporting different informations about the provided code.
